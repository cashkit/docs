# Introduction

Bitcoin Cash is an ideal blockchain with incredible throughput capacity, ability to scale, low transaction fees, 0-confirmation, and soon an EVM compatible side chain and much more. Itâ€™s a gem waiting to be discovered by the many.

There is a huge demand for Software Engineers and Developers who work on the Bitcoin Cash Ecosystem. This open-source organization consists of many small and medium-sized projects which use but are not limited to various node implementations\(BCHD\), libraries, languages\(Javascript, Go, Cashscript, and Python\), and cutting-edge technologies like gRPC and Docker. I hope that this organization will act as the go-to place for the new developer\(s\) to experiment and build something that can help grow the ecosystem.
