# Introduction

Bitcoin Cash is an ideal blockchain with incredible throughput capacity, ability to scale, low transaction fees, 0-confirmation and soon an EVM compatible side chain and much more. Itâ€™s a gem waiting to be discovered by the many.

There is a huge demand for Software Engineers and Developers who work on the Bitcoin Cash Ecosystem. **Cash Kit helps to solve this problem**. This open source project aims to be the goto place for any new developer\(s\) interested in working on Bitcoin Cash blockchain by making the onboarding of new teams and developers very easy. This kit provides extensive documentation and codebase, so developers can focus on their business logic and ship a production grade application within a couple of days instead of weeks or months.
